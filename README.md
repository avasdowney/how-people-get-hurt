# How People Get Hurt

## Project Description
Learning about how, when, and why people end up in the Emergency Room can help to upgrade medical quality, reduce patient complaints, and save waste of medical resources. It can unveil hidden medical knowledge through looking at the correlation and association of apparently independent variables. This new knowledge can be used to combat increased wait time, ambulance diversion, reduced staff morale, adverse patient outcomes such as increased mortality, and cancellation of elective procedures.

Through the use of different visualization techniques such as decision trees, clustering, and kmeans algorithms, different trends can be found in the data that would not otherwise have been able to easily be seen. 

## Data Source
This project uses a dataset from Kaggle called [How People Get Hurt](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/how-people-get-hurt) which details demographics about who ends up in the Emergency Department, as well as why they are there. This dataset is compiled from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) and includes data from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020.
