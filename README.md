# How People Get Hurt

## Project Description
Learning about how, when, and why people end up in the Emergency Room can help to upgrade medical quality, reduce patient complaints, and save waste of medical resources. It can unveil hidden medical knowledge through looking at the correlation and association of apparently independent variables. This new knowledge can be used to combat increased wait time, ambulance diversion, reduced staff morale, adverse patient outcomes such as increased mortality, and cancellation of elective procedures.

To find trends that may help to combat these issues, I will create a correlation matrix to see how different variables relate to eachother. This will help me figure out how to focus my project to find a meaningful path to follow. I will also look into how drug, alcohol, and fire involvment affect emergency room rates.

## Data Source
This project uses a dataset from Kaggle called [How People Get Hurt](https://www.kaggle.com/jpmiller/how-people-get-hurt) which details demographics about who ends up in the Emergency Department, as well as why they are there. This dataset is compiled from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) and includes data from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2020.
